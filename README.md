# SecureDrop
Drop. Encrypt. Share. Securely.

SecureDrop is a **modern web-based file encryption tool** designed to let users **encrypt files locally and share them securely**. The recipient can decrypt the file only with the correct password, ensuring **complete privacy and security**.

Drop a file, set a password, and share it confidently â€” all **encryption happens in the browser**, meaning your data **never leaves your device**.
